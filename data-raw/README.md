Data cleaning
================

I explicitly use this package to teach data cleaning, so have refactored my old cleaning code into several scripts. I also include them as compiled Markdown reports. Caveat: these are realistic cleaning scripts! Not the highly polished ones people write with 20/20 hindsight :) I wouldn't necessarily clean it the same way again (and I would download more recent data!), but at this point there is great value in reproducing the data I've been using for ~5 years.

Cleaning history

-   2010: The first time I documented cleaning this dataset. I started with delimited files I exported from Excel. Not present in this repo.
-   2014: I re-cleaned the data and (mostly) forced myself to pull it straight out of the spreadsheets. Used the `gdata` package. It was kind of painful, due to encoding and other issues. See the scripts in this state in [v0.1.0](https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder/tree/v0.1.0/data-raw).
-   2015: I revisited the cleaning and switched to `readxl`. This was much less painful. Present day.
-   2016: Added ISO country codes.
