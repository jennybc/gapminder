=========

```{r setup, include = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

Excerpt from the Gapminder data, as an R data package and in plain text delimited form. Premade color schemes for the countries and continents.

According to [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/data/), this data can be reused freely, but with attribution.

### Install and test drive

Install `gapminder` from GitHub:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jennybc/gapminder")
```

Load it and test drive with some data aggregation and plotting:

```{r test-drive}
library(gapminder)

aggregate(lifeExp ~ continent, gapminder, median)

suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
gapminder %>%
    filter(year == 2007) %>%
    group_by(continent) %>%
    summarise(lifeExp = median(lifeExp))
    
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = "hotpink") +
  geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0), alpha = 1/4)

ggplot(subset(gapminder, continent != "Oceania"),
       aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country, color = country)) +
  geom_line(lwd = 1, show_guide = FALSE) + facet_wrap(~ continent) +
  scale_color_manual(values = country_colors) +
  theme_bw() + theme(strip.text = element_text(size = rel(1.1)))
```

### Description of the dataset

I have used this excerpt in [STAT 545](http://stat545-ubc.github.io) since 2008 and, more recently, in [R-flavored Software Carpentry Workshops](http://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc/) and a [`ggplot2` tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial). I've been amazed at how useful and durable this dataset is for teaching data analysis with R.

Description:

  * 1704 observations; fills a size niche between `iris` (150 rows) and the likes of `diamonds` (54K rows)
  * 6 variables
    - `country` a factor with 142 levels
    - `continent`, a factor with 5 levels
    - `year`: going from 1952 to 2007 in increments of 5 years
    - `pop`: population
    - `gdpPercap`: GDP per capita
    - `lifeExp`: life expectancy

There are 12 rows for each country, i.e. complete data for 1952, 1955, ..., 2007.

The two factors provide opportunities to demonstrate factor handling, in aggregation and visualization, for factors with very few and very many levels.

The four quantitative variables are generally quite correlated with each other and these trends have interesting relationships to `country` and `continent`, so you will find that simple plots and aggregations tell a reasonable story and are not completely boring.

Visualization of the temporal trends in life expectancy, by country, is particularly rewarding, since there are several countries with sharp drops due to political upheaval. This then motivates more systematic investigations via data aggregation to proactively identify all countries whose data exhibits certain properties.

### How this sausage was made

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Data cleaning code cannot be clean. It&#39;s a sort of sin eater.</p>&mdash; Stat Fact (@StatFact) <a href="https://twitter.com/StatFact/status/492753200190341120">July 25, 2014</a></blockquote>

The [`data-raw`](data-raw) directory contains all of the scripts used to extract the data from the Excel spreadsheets downloaded from [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org) in 2008 and 2009. All underlying and intermediate data is there as well, going back to the Excel files themselves.

I explicitly use this package to teach data cleaning, so have refactored my old cleaning code into several scripts and also include compiled Markdown reports *(no Markdown yet; see [iss#1](https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder/issues/1))*. In hindsight, I wouldn't necessarily clean it the same way again (and I would download more recent data!), but at this point there is great value in reproducing the data I've been using for ~5 years.

### Plain text delimited files

I make available two plain text, tab delimited `.tsv` files:

  * [`gapminder.tsv`](inst/gapminder.tsv): the same dataset available via `library(gapminder); gapminder`. Each of the 142 countries presents complete data for 12 years: 1952, 1957, ..., 2007.
  * [`gapminder-unfiltered.tsv`](inst/gapminder-unfiltered.tsv): the larger dataset that, __when filtered__, yields [`gapminder.tsv`](inst/gapminder.tsv). In this file, I have NOT filtered for the years 1952, 1957, ..., 2007, I retain countries with incomplete data, and I did not impute data for China in 1952.
  
The main package dataset has 142 * 12 = 1704 rows, whereas the larger, unfiltered dataset contains 3312 rows, almost twice as much data.

Here in this repo, these delimited files can be found:

  * in the [`inst/`](inst) sub-directory
  
Once you've installed the `gapminder` package they can be found locally and used like so:
  
```{r}
gap_tsv <- system.file("gapminder.tsv", package = "gapminder")
gap_tsv <- read.delim(gap_tsv)
str(gap_tsv)
gap_tsv %>% # Bhutan did not make the cut because data for only 8 years :(
  filter(country == "Bhutan")

gap_bigger_tsv <- system.file("gapminder-unfiltered.tsv", package = "gapminder")
gap_bigger_tsv <- read.delim(gap_bigger_tsv)
str(gap_bigger_tsv)
gap_bigger_tsv %>% # Bhutan IS here though! :)
  filter(country == "Bhutan")
```

## Color schemes

Continent specific colors were selected from `RColorBrewer` palettes.

These were then expanded into a larger set of colors to cover all the countries in each continent, where darker colors correspond to countries with a larger population.

The schemes are provided as named character vectors:

```{r}
head(country_colors, 4)
head(continent_colors)
```

The country scheme is available in this repo as [PNG](data-raw/gapminder-color-scheme-ggplot2.png) and [PDF](data-raw/gapminder-color-scheme-base.pdf).
